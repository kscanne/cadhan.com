<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>
Cadhan Aonair, LLC is a private company founded in 2008
that provides technology services to the Irish language community
around the world.
Our mission is to enable Irish speakers to live their computing life 
completely through the language, by providing software,
proofing tools, web sites, APIs, and software localisations.

<h2>What's here</h2>
<p>
In the menu to the left, you'll find links to all of our products.
Everything here is freely available, along with the source code
and open datasets that power our software. Making these resources
available under open licenses enables other developers to use them
as the basis for their
own projects. We believe strongly that this is the best way to ensure
a healthy technology ecosystem for the Irish language online.
